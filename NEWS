Release 0.9.4 added 3 script files: Outliers_fdata.R, 
flm_beta_estimation_brownian_data.R and Classif_phoneme.R.
It has introduced the functions fregre.glm and 
predict.fregre.glm which allow fit and predict
respectively Functional Generalized Linear Models.
It has introduced the functions create.pc.basis and 
create.fdata.basis  which allow to create basis objects
for functional data of class "fdata".

Release 0.9 introduces a new function h.default that 
simplifies the calculation of the bandwidth parameter
"h" in the functions: fregre.np, fregre.np.cv and fregre.plm.  
In most of the functions has added a stop control when the
dataset has missing data (NA's). It adds the attribute "call"
to the distance  matrix calculated in metric.lp, 
semimetric.basis  and semimetric.NPFDA functions.
